Tear the roof off, we're gonna tear the roof off the mothersucker
Tear the roof off the sucker
(x4)

You've got a real type of thing going down, gettin' down
There's a whole lot of rhythm going round
(x2)

Ow, we want the funk
Give up the funk
Ow, we need the funk
We gotta have that funk
(x2)

La la la la la
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, owww!
(x2)

You've got a real type of thing going down, gettin' down
There's a whole lot of rhythm going round
(x2)

Ow, we want the funk
Give up the funk
Ow, we need the funk
We gotta have that funk
