[Verse 1]
My, my - at Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender
Oh, yeah - and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

[Pre-Chorus]
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

[Chorus]
Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

[Verse 2]
My, my - I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh, yeah - and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

[Pre-Chorus]
And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

[Chorus]
Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

[Pre-Chorus]
So how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

[Outro]
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
Woo, Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
Woo, Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
